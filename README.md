##first steep:
 infinite loop in each thread to run the simulation 
##second steep:
	crate my own sleep function to make the thread sleep for a specific time
##third steep:
	think is ownly waiting to eat so need to add a new function to print the action think
##fourth steep:
	add sleep action to print the sleep action and to wait the specific time
##fifth steep:
	check if everting is secronized with the philosofers simulaser 
##sixth steep:
	check the data RACE (with --sanitize=thread)
##five  steep:
	make main thread to check death and numerbers of meals and quit the simulation
